    One of my favorite places that I have ever been to is Montana.  Montana is located in the northwestern corridor of the United States, and is home to many of my favorite activites like skiing, fishing, and hiking.  My favorite thing to do in Montana is to go skiing at their largest ski resort Big Sky.  Big Sky is home to someo of the biggest skiing in America and some of the toughest terrain anywhere in the country.  I grew up skiing there and I am very comfortable on this particular mountain at this point.  I have even ventured to the highest point on the mountain known as "Lone Peak".  Standing at the top of Lone Peak allows you to see across most of the state and even some of the neighboring states as well.  Montana will always be one of my favorite places to go to and I have no intentions of ending my visits there anytime soon.
